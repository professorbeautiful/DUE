NOTES on building the package and running the app.

To run the app, 
shiny::runApp('inst/DUEshiny', launch.browser = TRUE)
To build vignettes,
  devtools::build_vignettes()
Building DUE vignettes
Moving DUE_vignette-no-base64.html, DUE_vignette-no-base64.R to inst/doc/
Copying DUE_vignette-no-base64.Rmd to inst/doc/

==>>  ln ./inst/doc/DUE_vignette-no-base64.html ./inst/DUEshiny/www/
This seems to get the html file into inst/DUEshiny/www OK.
Does not need to be re-done. Repeating build_vignettes worked.
File appears when clicking Run App.
But people who download the package from git may not know to do this.



Previous error:
  FAILS:  devtools::install(build_vignettes = TRUE)
  Error is 
    cp: DUE/inst/DUEshiny/www/DUE_vignette.html: No such file or directory
  Possibly due to the usage of a file link (to save the need to copy).
I removed the link and did
   cp inst/doc/DUE_vignette.html inst/DUEshiny/www
"by hand".
But now, the link works ok. So still confused, but ok.

Under the Knit dropdown, Knit Directory has to be set to Document Directory,
or else the example files can't be found.

The html output is at
   file:///private/var/folders/6v/y_cp6z4d22ggbgrqdk0g73v80000gv/T/Rtmpvk0cV1/preview-289e5856c5fd.dir/DUE_vignette.html
   
This web address does bring up the vignette (jan 4, 2017):
  https://trials.shinyapps.io/DUEshiny/_w_95d74301/DUE_vignette.html
  
  
The dilmemma: use the same rmarkdown body both for the vignette and for the html to show up in the Info window for the app.
Here we go:
  system.file(package='DUE', 'doc/DUE_vignette.html')
For vignette:
---
title: "DUE, the Dose Utility Explorer"
author: "Roger Day, Marie Gerges"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
# output: html_document
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
  %\VignetteIndexEntry{"DUE, the Dose Utility Explorer"}
  %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
  %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
numbersections: TRUE
---
title: "DUE, the Dose Utility Explorer"
author: "Roger Day, Marie Gerges"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  html_document: default
  pdf_document: default

TODO:
Make sure the screen for the app is set at the proper zoom.

file.symlink(system.file("doc", "DUE_vignette.html", package="DUE"), 'www')  might be helpful, probably unnecesary.
 
The multimodality section.
Support batch calculations.
